"<h1>&nbsp;</h1><p>Content types to change up your blogging</p><h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>1. Listicles</strong></h3><p>Everybody loves a list. They’re easy to scan, have digestible information and they’re super popular for social media sharing.</p><p>You can create lists on almost any subject. It could be your favourite books or a list of your top bloggers to follow.</p><p>Here are two great examples of listicles:</p><ul><li><a href="https://toneisland.com/space-saving-speaker-cabinets-for-guitarists/">10 Great Space-Saving Speaker Cabinets For Guitarists</a></li><li><a href="https://nikolaroza.com/the-best-minecraft-server-hosting/">11 Best Minecraft Server Hosting Providers</a></li></ul><p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Build your lists around your main blog niche and topics to stay relevant to your audience.

Written tutorials and how to’s</strong></h3><p>Tutorials and how-to guides are a great way to engage your audience and educate them in a single blog post. Plus, they’re easy to work on too since you’re already familiar with the topic.</p><p>The key thing to remember when writing how-to guides is to break things down into small actionable steps. This makes it easier for readers to follow your instructions. Including step-by-step screenshots further aids in this, especially for visual learners.</p><p>Marketing bloggers could write tutorials on how to use different social media platforms. Beauty bloggers can guide their readers through makeup applications. It all depends on your target audience and what they want to read.</p><p>Here’s an example from YourCreativeAura.com: <a href="https://yourcreativeaura.com/how-to-write-a-song/">How To Write A Song: Songwriting Basics</a>, this post is broken into the 5 main sections of song creation, along with imagery and examples to make it easier for beginners to understand.</p><h3 style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>3. Video tutorials</strong></h3><p>If writing full guides on a subject seems too daunting for you, you can always create a video tutorial instead. Video is hugely popular – sometimes more popular than the written word, so utilising it in your blog makes a lot of sense.</p><p>Your options for video tutorials include:</p><ul><li>Filming yourself explaining things</li><li>Filming a screencast of you performing the tutorial steps</li><li>Filming a screencast with a voice-over explaining as you go through the steps.</li></ul><p>When posting your tutorial to your blog, you can either host the video directly on your website by uploading it. Or, you could upload it to a <a href="https://bloggingwizard.com/video-hosting-sites/">video hosting site</a> like YouTube or Vimeo and embed it in a blog post on your site.nnccc</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:83.09%;"><img src="http://masnikkas3-storage.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/0fb7a255c04891aaaa95d068afeb4300" alt="test image 1"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><pre><code class="language-javascript"> &lt;div id='63a042bb3ff209d855d2175f'&gt;&lt;div/&gt;</code></pre><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
